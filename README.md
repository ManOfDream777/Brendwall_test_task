# Getting Started

### Install repo (clone or zip whatever you like)

### install requirements for python with req.txt (sure use venv first)

`pip install -r req.txt`

# React dependencies

## For some reason axios was not added to package.json.
## Install it manually after installation of package.json


### `npm start` - Start React Dev server
### `python manage.py runserver` - Start Django Dev server

### Of course change and use different directories to apply commands.
### Happy testing!
